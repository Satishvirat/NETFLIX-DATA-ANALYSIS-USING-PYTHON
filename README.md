In this data analysis project, i have utilized Python's Matplotlib library to visually explore a Netflix dataset. I focused on genres, displaying the distribution of movies and TV shows across different genres. Additionally, i have highlighted countries contributing significantly to Netflix by visualizing the proportion of TV shows from each country. A temporal analysis is also performed to showcase the growth of content releases over the years.This project showcases the power of data visualization in extracting valuable insights from entertainment datasets.
